            <p>ML Persona: <strong>Marie's story</strong> </p> 
          </div>


          <div class="two-column">
              <p class="title">Welcome to the real world</p>
              <p>Marie is a new CS graduate. She took some courses in machine learning and has participated in a few Kaggle competitions. After school, she joined a medium size company as a data scientist. Soon she realized what she did before, was just a small part of the picture.
              </p>
              <img src="img/mlflow/AI_realworld.png">

              <p class="title">Why is that?</p>
             
              <p>
              Why? What has changed since she practiced ML in school? One word: <strong>scale</strong>. By looking deeper, there are 3 key issues she needs to worry about in ML lifecycle. 
                <ul class="list">
                  <li><strong>Big data:</strong> Data is the fuel. Accessing and preparing big volume and variety of raw data requires more computing resources and a new form of parallel processing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Product quality:</strong> Business expects ML to drive innovation. One needs to try various ML algorithms and run multiple experiments (model training) to get the best result.</li>
                  <li><strong>Production:</strong> After getting the best result (a model), next is to move it to production (deploy), it can be challenging due to a plethora of deployment tools and environment a model needs to run in. </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <img src="img/mlflow/MLChallenges.png">


              <p class="title">Ups and downs</p>
              <p>Marie freaked out. Luckily she got a team to cover her back. She has a data engineer who helps process the data and another infrastructure engineer deploy the model. She can focus on what she specializes in - picking up the best model. 
              <br/><br/>
              So Marie went ahead and tried a bunch of different algorithms & hyper-parameters, she looked at the result, saw what's working, refined and tried again. It was a highly iterative process and soon she got lost in her hundreds of experiments. One of the experiments had the best result but what were the inputs? She could not reproduce the model. 
              </p>

              <br/><br/>
              <p class="title">Introducing MLFlow</p>
              <p>
                Matt, the data engineer in Marie's team sent her a link to MLFlow, a new open source machine learning platform from Apache Spark creator. Marie was not alone - hundreds of companies using ML have the same challenge: <strong>it is hard to track experiments and reproduce results</strong>.  
                <br/><br/>
                The MLFlow not only addresses one challenge. It also standardizes the way to package model and move it to production, which helped Marie downstream where she hands off her model to the infrastructure engineer.

            <p>BEHIND THE SCENE</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>How does it feel like working on this project from a designer's perspective? <strong>Worthwhile</strong>. Here are 4 phases I went through.</p>

            <div class="one-column">
              <p>PHASE 1</p>
            </div>


            <div class="two-column">
                <p class="title">Do the homework and speak the same language</p>
                <p>For a designer, this's probably the hardest part. The ML domain is complex and full of jargons. Besides reading ML tutorials and taking online courses, I also relied on our ML experts walking us through the ML workflow and the taxonomy so we can all speak the same language.

                <p class="title">Synthesize the learnings and visualize the journey</p>
                <p>Next we conduct user interviews to further understand ML engineers' workflow and hear the painpoints in their day-to-day work. Patterns are emerging around model training & deployment & management. The feedback from the field also repeated similar challenges. We synthesize the learnings into a user journey map for easy reference and knowledge sharing.

                <p class="title">Keep calm and carry on</p>
                <p>After we released MLFlow at Spark Summit on June 5th 2018, we got great media coverage and lots of customer interests. We also saw positive community feedback. It is a big milestone but still a long way to go. We are working with our customers and the community to iterate and add more features. We also start to look at solving other challenges on model management and deployment. Stay tuned!
